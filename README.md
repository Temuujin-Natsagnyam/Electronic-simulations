# Electronic-simulations

Using matplotlib to animate and graph voltage across components in Python 3.

Mostly focused on Low-pass filters, and High-pass filters.

These electronic filters allow unwanted frequencies to be blocked. For example, a low pass filter blocks of high frequency.

This project was done together with my father, an electrical engineer.
